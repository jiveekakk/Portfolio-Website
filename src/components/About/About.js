              <p>
                 Much like a young Padawan emerging from the Jedi Temple, Iâ€™ve been sharpening my skills in software development 
                 through my BSc in IT studies and hands-on internship experiences.
                  My training has equipped me with the foundational knowledge and real-world exposure to navigate the galaxy of modern tech.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey into the world of technology began with a sparkâ€”my first line of code.
                 It was as if I had just discovered my connection to the Force. 
                 Since then, I've been driven by a passion to use technology not just as a tool,
                  but as a way to bring balanceâ€”solving real problems with creative and impactful solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
              When Iâ€™m not buried in code or debugging the universe, Iâ€™m out leveling up in real life.
              Whether it's crushing personal records at the gym or chasing the bass drop at a rave or Festival is my playground.
              Iâ€™m a lifelong sports junkie with loyalty split between Manchester United and Real Madrid, 
              adrenaline-fueled F1 Sundays with Ferrari, and a soft spot for tennis legend Rafa Nadal (Wimbledon will never be the same ðŸ’”).
              </p>
              <p>
                But beyond the muscle and match days, Iâ€™m a massive geek at heart. Give me anything Marvel, Harry Potter,
                 or pure science fiction nonsense and Iâ€™ll lose hours happily nerding out. I live for the side quests,
                 finding hidden gems, vibing with new people, and unlocking experiences across my city. 
                 And yes, I do unreasonably drop too much cash on clothes, but call it character development.
                Catch me balancing grind and glow-up, one adventure (or outfit) at a time.
